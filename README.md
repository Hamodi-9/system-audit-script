# 🛠️ System Audit Script (macOS)

---

Hi! This is a simple Bash script I wrote to quickly check system health on macOS. It gives you a snapshot of:

- 🖥️ Hostname and uptime  
- 🧠 CPU model and number of cores  
- 💾 Total memory (RAM)  
- 💽 Disk usage on your root drive  
- ⚙️ Top 5 memory-hungry processes  
- 🔐 Open network ports  
- 👥 Logged-in users

## 🔧 How to Use

Make sure you're on macOS with Bash installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamodi-9/system-audit-script.git

cd system-audit-script

chmod +x system-audit.sh

./system-audit.sh

```
